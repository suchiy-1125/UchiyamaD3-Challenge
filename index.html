          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>In this research, data from US Census Bureau is used to see the correlation discovered between Health Risk and Age, Income. 
            Each circle in the scatterplot shows State and the relationship between different factors.
          </p>

          <p>There is a positive correlation between poverty and health status of people. As the poverty percentage goes up, the percentage of people without healthcare goes up. 
            Since the healthcare system is expensive, the people in poverty may not be in healthcare.
            </p>

          <p> People with lower income tend to have higher risk of health such as obesity an and smoking. It is shown in the scatter plot that obesity is another factor that is related to the household income. 
            As the percentage of poverty increases, the percentage lacking the healthcare increases. Another risk related to people with low income is smoking. There is a relationship between smoke and the household income. 
            For state with lower household income, the percentage of smokers tend to go up. As smoking is a cause of multiple disesase, the people with low income tend to have higher risk of getting those diseases.</p>
